## Overview

This portfolio project is built using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) with React Router for navigation between pages. It includes standard portfolio pages—Home, About, and Contact—as well as a Projects section that integrates three functional demo apps:
- **Task Management Web App:** A simple task tracker using local state management.
- **E-commerce Store Prototype:** A basic storefront with dummy product data and a simulated checkout process.
- **Data Visualization for Business Insights:** A demo for visualizing data in a table (and with potential for interactive charts).
